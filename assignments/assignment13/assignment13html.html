        <h2>hi.</h2>
        <div id="shortBio">
          <p>I am a <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/anthony-pinter"> Teaching Assistant Professor in the ATLAS Institute</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder. I completed my PhD in Information Science, also at CU Boulder, working with <a href="https://www.jedbrubaker.com">Jed Brubaker</a> and <a href="https://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/">the Identity Lab</a>. My research interests focus on understanding the experiences people have during life transitions and how those experiences are represented in sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in how people make decisions about the data that are left behind in the wake of a romantic relationship ending, and how those decisions contribute to the formation of post-break-up identities.</p>
          <p>I am concurrently <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/directory/atp136">an Adjunct Part-Time Faculty member</a> in Penn State's College of Information Sciences and Technology, where I have taught through Penn State's World Campus program since 2016.</p>
          <p>For more information about my past and present professional activities, see <a href="/assets/pintercv.pdf">my curriculum vitae</a>. For more about me, have a look at the <a href="/#about">about page</a>.</p>
