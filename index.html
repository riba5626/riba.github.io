  <h1><b>Hey I'm Riley.</b></h1>  
<h2>I use she/her pronouns and I have a lot of <em>little hobbies.</em></h2>
<h3>I <strong>love</strong> to thrift and repurpose old clothing into new things. Shooting on Super8 film is one of my favorite things in the world, as I'm a very nostalgic person. I love my friends and horses are my favorite animal!</h3>
<h4>My goals for this class are to work on my coding skills and be able to build something from the ground up (especially if its creative)! </h4>
