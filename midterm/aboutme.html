    <h1><b>Hey I'm Riley.</b></h1>  
<p>
  I've been a creative at heart for quite some time, and put most of my energy towards capturing my world through artistic mediums.
  I've always had this inner instinct to live my life with an aesthetic that is genuine to me. But this aesthetic isn't just in my style of art, its more of a way in which I choose to perceive things and produce things.
