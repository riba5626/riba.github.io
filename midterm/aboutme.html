              <p> 
                    I've been a creative at heart for quite some time, and put most of my energy towards capturing my world through artistic mediums.
                I've always had this inner instinct to live my life with an aesthetic that is genuine to me. But this aesthetic isn't just in my style of art, it's more of a way in which I choose to perceive things and produce things. 
                This is seen in the clothing I wear, the conversations I choose to have, the friends I keep around, and the activities I do in my free time. I do all of these things with a specificity to conform to my “vision” of life or what I think it should be.
                
                <p>
                    I see life through this artistic lens with the idea that everything should have an intention to inspire others. I believe everyone shouldn't take reality too seriously, as many of the things that reality should be are just facades pushed by old ideals and capitalism. 
                This idea of going to school, getting a 9-5 job, marrying, having kids, and then retirement should not be strictly followed. I'm not saying to disregard any guidelines, but to have no room in between to truly find yourself and experience the world is just robbing us of expanding our creative selves and inspiring others to do the same. 

                </p>
             </p>
                    Having pondered on questions like these for a few years now has really driven my brand and vision for not just my art, but my life as well. Precious time in our development as humans is cut short because of the belief that the rat race is our priority and the key to success. 
                This has allowed me to really want to capture youth culture as it is today. In any medium, whether that be photography, film, or physical mediums, I want to capture the rawness of what really goes on behind closed doors in our evolution as a generation. 
                
            <p>Both to inspire those who are with us now, and to be able to show my kids that there are many ways to live out your genuine self. I feel like my main source of inspiration comes from generational trends in fashion and art. The aesthetics of the 70's and 90's drive my style and that flows over into my photos and art. 
                    The music scene also plays a huge role in my style and aesthetics. Growing up in southern california I was (and still am) really into the surf rock scene and that helped me to curate my brand a lot.

	                Not only is my brand capturing portraits or lifestyle photos of youth culture, but it's also capturing what these people see and how they may experience it. For example, I remember walking around for the first time by myself in a city. I think this is universal for all young adults, but I was looking through a different lens that day.
                Everything seemed new, vibrant, and moody all at the same time. Learning to live on our own and experiencing the many facets this world has to offer is a huge part of youth culture. I also have noticed that this generation attempts to romanticize a lot of things people have looked past. 
                This is my brand: romanticizing the things looked over and making every aspect of our social and individual lives beautiful through color, liveliness, and moods.
